# keeper-app
A web app to keep your notes.  
I made it to practice my fullstack(react, express, mongoDB) skills.
~~This is only a frontend website, I will add the backend when I am done learning it.~~  

## Update 2  
I added the database to the application, I used mongoDB with mongoose ODM.  
There is always a room for improvements, so there may be more updates later.  

## Update 1  
I added the backend functionality using axios api to commuinicate with the backend server.  
Next step is to connect it with a database, I will add it when I learn it :) .
