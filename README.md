# keeper-app
A web app to keep your notes.  
I made it to practice my react skills.  
~~This is only a frontend website, I will add the backend when I am done learning it.~~  
## Update 1  
I added the backend functionality using axios api to commuinicate with the backend server.  
Next step is to connect it with a database, I will add it when I learn it :) .
